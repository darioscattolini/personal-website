        <p>
          I have a strong logical and analytical mindset: I feel at ease with 
          programming rather than aesthetics and design, so I lean towards a 
          full-stack profile. As a philosopher I also favour a systematic and 
          principled approach to coding. I'm not happy just with getting things 
          done: I need to understand what's going on, so I take my time to learn 
          and systematize my knowledge on the inner working and the murky parts of
          the tools and languages I use.
